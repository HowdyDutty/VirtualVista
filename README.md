OpenGL Endeavours
=================

How to compile
---------------

From within the project directory: 
```
$	cc -o out.exe src/main.cpp -lglfw3 -framework Cocoa -framework OpenGL -framework IOKit -framework CoreVideo
```

To run:
```
$	./out.exe
```
Notes
------

This only works on Mac OS X, for now.

Will extend to other operating systems in the future.
