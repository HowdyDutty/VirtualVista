How to compile and run
---------------

####Through Terminal

```
cd path/to/VirtualVista
./build.sh
```

####CLion: 

CLion is easy, simply hit RUN and do good things.

It should be noted that GLEW does not have CMake style make files. This is a problem that I have yet to
resolve. For now, the only way to include it into the project is to manually install it based on the 
instructions they give [here](https://github.com/LuaDist/glew).

Notes
------

This only works on Mac OS X... for now.

Will extend to other operating systems in the future.
