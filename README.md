=================

How to compile and run
---------------

From Terminal:
```
cc -o out.exe src/main.cpp -lglfw3 -framework Cocoa -framework OpenGL -framework IOKit -framework CoreVideo && ./out.exe
```

From within CLion: 

CMake works, so simply hit RUN and do good things.

Notes
------

This only works on Mac OS X, for now.

Will extend to other operating systems in the future.
