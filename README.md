Virtual Vista
=================

Soon to be procedural graphics engine.

Build
---------------

Install all platform dependecies first:
``` bash
./install_deps.sh
```

Recommended building with script as several environment vars are needed to keep glfw from building extra executables.
``` bash
./compile.sh
```

Works and tested on both OS X 10.10.X and Ubuntu 14.04
