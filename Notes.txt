This is a general note taking file used for keeping my objectives clear.

Rendering
---------
I was initially thinking of making a Factory to manage creation/deletion of poly's, but as I started 
running into comprehension issues with OpenGL, I realized that I should focus on a workable build of 
the software first and adding in abstractions later. 

With that said, I'm putting a hold on the Factory pattern for poly creation. 

I am going to emulate the same thing by using a few functions within the renderer class.

	- init (creates the initial poly's in the scene)
	- draw (tests whether any of the poly's need updating, updates them, then renders them)

Premature optimization is a buzz kill.
